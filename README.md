# Devfinder

Desenvolvido durante o bootcamp da Digital Inovation One, o projeto tinha como objetivo criar uma interface componentizada para buscar os dados de uma api do gitHub.

O objetivo foi cumprido com sucesso, utilizei também como modelo de layout o projeto do site frontend mentor que também tem a mesma ideia principal.

Nesse projeto eu aprendi a utilizar o hook useContext, conseguir fazer com que minha aplicação tivesse dois **provider** um para o thema e outro para a API. Onde cada parte **consome** apenas o necessário.

- ReactJS
- React Hooks
- Styled Components
- Axios
- Moment JS

## Desafios enfrentados

Passei muito tempo pesquisando e tentadno enteder como funcionava o useContext, foi nessa busca que aprendi seu funcionamento e para colocar em prática apliquei o useContext na troca de tema por toda a aplicação.

## Agradecimento

Agradecimento especial para o [Matheus Benits](https://github.com/benits) que foi o professor da digital Inovation e que quando tive duvidas me orientou e ajudou a resolver os erros da minha aplicação.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
